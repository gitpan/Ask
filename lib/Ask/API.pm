=head1 NAME

Ask::API - an API to ask users things

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	{
		package Ask::AwesomeWidgets;
		use Moo;
		with 'Ask::API';
		sub info {
			my ($self, %arguments) = @_;
			...
		}
		sub entry {
			my ($self, %arguments) = @_;
			...
		}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Ask::API> is a L<Moo> role. This means that you can write your
implementation as either a Moo or Moose class.

The only two methods that you absolutely must implement are C<info> and
C<entry>.

C<Ask::API> provides default implementations of C<warning>, C<error>,
C<question> and C<file_selection> methods, but they're not espcially
good, so you probably want to implement them too.

There is not currently any mechanism to "register" your implementation
with L<Ask> so that C<< Ask->detect >> knows about it.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Ask>.
